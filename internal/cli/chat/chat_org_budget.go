// taskWorkers bounds the dynamic-org workers of a turn in a conversation that
// belongs to an AI task. The turn's cap (opts.BudgetUSD, what admission
// granted) is shared: the workers get a pool of up to half of it, or the
// operator's org budget when that is lower, and the lead keeps the rest, so
// together they can't spend more than the task has left. An org budget of 0
// is not "no limit" here. Each worker run reserves part of the pool in the
// ledger before it starts (atomically, so workers running together can't
// reserve more than the pool) and settles what it spent when it ends.
//
// ok is false for a conversation with no open task: nothing changes. A task
// turn with no cap to share, or one whose reason to refuse is returned, runs
// without workers.
