// it reads the settings saved with `api config` (see `api config show` for what a running
// daemon started with). It reads the saved settings first and refuses when they cannot be used:
// a daemon that cannot use them starts without the OpenAI-compatible API, and a restart would
// replace one that serves it with that.
