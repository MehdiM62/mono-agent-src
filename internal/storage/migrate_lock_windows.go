// lockFile takes an exclusive LockFileEx lock on byte 0 of f and waits for
// whichever process is migrating the same database (no
// LOCKFILE_FAIL_IMMEDIATELY), like the blocking flock on unix.
//
// The kernel releases the lock when the handle closes or the process dies, so
// there is no heartbeat, staleness or PID logic. Locks belong to the file
// handle: two opens of the lock file in one process also contend, as with
// flock. os.OpenFile handles are non-inheritable, so child processes (monomind
// and the like) never hold the lock, and they are synchronous (no
// FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED), so a zeroed Overlapped with offset 0 is enough. The
// lock file is separate from the database file, leaving SQLite's own Windows
// locking on the database unaffected. It is held only for the migration
// (callers defer unlockFile).
